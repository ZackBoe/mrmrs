    <h1 class="h2">Skills and Tools</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy solving business problems with visual design and code. It doesn't matter 
      too much what the problem is, just that I get to try and solve it really well 
      with people I like. I'm equally comfortable kerning type or writing a custom vim 
      script to improve a colleagues development efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently spend most of my time designing responsive and readable interfaces 
      that are easy to navigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite tools to get the job done are: vim, unix, html, css, js, regex, a modern 
      web browser, pen, and paper.
