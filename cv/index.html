    <h1 class="h2">Skills and Tools</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy solving problems with visual design, code, and oxford commas. I currently 
      spend most of my time designing responsive and readable interfaces that are easy 
      to navigate, light-weight, and high-performing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite tools to get the job done are: vim, unix, html, css, js, regex, a 
      modern web browser, pen, and paper.
