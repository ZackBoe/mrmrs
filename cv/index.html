    <h1 class="h2">Skills and Tools</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy solving problems with visual design and code.
      I'm equally comfortable kerning type or automating tasks with command line applications.
      I currently spend most of my time designing responsive and readable interfaces 
      that are easy to navigate, light weight, and high-performing.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite tools to get the job done are: vim, unix, html, css, js, regex, a modern 
      web browser, pen, and paper.
